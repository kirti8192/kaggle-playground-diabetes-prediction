# Kaggle Playground – Diabetes Prediction

Personal playground project to practice an end-to-end ML workflow on a small, clean tabular dataset.  
Goal is learning-by-doing, not leaderboard chasing.

## What I’m Practicing
- Quick EDA to understand feature distributions and target balance
- Basic preprocessing (scaling, encoding, handling leakage)
- Building simple baselines first
- Iterating with better models and hyperparameters
- Evaluating properly (train/val split, cross-validation)

## Workflow Reminder
1. Load + sanity check data
2. EDA → identify obvious signals and issues
3. Baseline model (logistic / tree)
4. Improve with feature engineering + model tuning
5. Validate and reflect on what actually helped

## Notes to Self
- Keep it simple; don’t over-engineer
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Track what changed between experiments
- Focus on understanding *why* a model improves
